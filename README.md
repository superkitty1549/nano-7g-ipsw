if you select the weird clock screen with the steps it'll be just a normal black lockscreen with the days sun/mon/tue/wed/etc... in comic sans ms and then the date and then the time also in comic sans ms and it's actually all in comic sans ms

then at the bottom isntead of the shoe it's a purple pixel heart and then all the step numbers are made black so you cant see them


and then theres custom icons (thank the pacific theme) and custom walpapers

oh and also some of the stuff is purple instead of default teehee

update daijoubu desu ka is the newest, font changed to amatic sc, hello kitty wallpaper replaced with some other thing, still pretty icons, changed font of the lock screen from comic sans ms to something less stupid
